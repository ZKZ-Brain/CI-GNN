## The Architecture of CI-GNN

![](framework.png)

**Figure 1 ï»¿Architecture of our proposed CI-GNN.**  The model consists of four modules: GraphVAE, causal effect estimator, causal subgraph generator and a basic classifier $\varphi$. Given an input Graph $G=\{(A,X)\}$, GraphVAE learns (disentangled) latent factors $Z=[\alpha;\beta]$. The causal effect estimator ensures that only $\alpha$ is causally related to label $Y$ by the conditional mutual information (CMI) regularization $I\left ( \alpha; Y|\beta \right )$. Based on $\alpha$, we introduce another linear decoder $\theta_2$ to generate causal subgraph $\mathcal{G}_{\text{sub}}$, which can then be used for graph classification by classifier $\varphi$.
